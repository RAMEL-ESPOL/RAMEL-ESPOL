description: Grasping and holding objects are essential tasks for  robotic manipulators. However, the development of universal grippers capable of manipulating unknown objects with widely varying shapes and surface properties remains a challenge. To address this, we present a novel reconfigurable soft gripper (OobSoft) based on Oobleck, deposited on a rubber membrane with a  two-finger configuration with an actuation mechanism. This article presents a prototype and the development of this soft gripper with grasping and holding capabilities enabled by a simple actuation mechanism. This objective was achieved by taking advantage of a combination of soft materials, including the properties of Oobleck, rubber, and a bio inspired design. When pressed on a target object, the fingers (Oobleckinside a rubber membrane) flow around the object and conform to its shape. Upon application of the actuation mechanism, the viscosity of the Oobleck increases, so it quickly hardens topinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. The development of the soft gripper is explained by the characteristics of the Oobleck and the prototype. The design of the soft gripper involved the anthropomorphic approach used in the design of the fingers. The results of grasping objects and the ability to hold them in position were demonstrated through experimental tests.
