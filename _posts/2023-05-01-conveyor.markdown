description: This project describes the design of a conveyor beltmanipulator for repositioning boxes to locate the bar code sidein the right position to be sensed in a logistic center. The generalrule is that a few pairs of hands touch the package as possiblein  parcel  logistics  centers,  ideally  just  three.  First  for  loading,second  for  unloading  the  containers,  and  third  for  a  workerhas to place the packages on the conveyor logistic system in theright  position,  i.e.,  the  bar  code  must  be  visible  by  the  visionsystem. The correct position of the bar code is essential for thevision  systems  to  check  the  delivery  information  and  managethe package automatically through the correct conveyor in thelogistics  centers.  That  process  needs  to  be  automated  usinga  collaborative  robot  (COBOT)  and  a  specific  manipulatordesign  for  that  task.  In  this  work,  we  present  a  repositionboxes methodology with a novel conveyor belt manipulator. Ournovel design has been achieved by analyzing the manipulationcharacteristics needed to control, rotate, and flip boxes in a reallogistic industry. Then, a prototype was built and tested in thelaboratory..
